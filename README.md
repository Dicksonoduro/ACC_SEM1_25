This is a responsive product list code containing html, javascript, and CSS
This product card presents essential information in a clean, hierarchical layout: a prominent product image, a bold title (e.g., "Apple MacBook Pro 14"), key specifications, the price, and a clear "Add to Cart" call-to-action button.
Considering responsiveness, this card design would adapt well. On larger screens, multiple cards would likely sit side-by-side in a grid. Each card would typically stack vertically on smaller screens (like mobile), occupying more of the screen width. The image and text would resize proportionally, and the "Add to Cart" button might span the full width of the card for easier tapping, ensuring readability and usability across various device sizes
